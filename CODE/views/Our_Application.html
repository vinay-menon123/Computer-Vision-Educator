        Automatic emotion recognition based on facial expression is an interesting research field, which has been presented and applied in several areas such as safety, health and in human machine interfaces.
        With the remarkable success of deep learning, the different types of architectures of this technique are exploited to achieve a better performance.

                Sentiment analysis is extremely useful in social media monitoring as it allows us to gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics.
                The applications of sentiment analysis are broad and powerful. 
                The ability to extract insights from social data is a practice that is being widely adopted by organizations across the world.

    <h1> HOW IT WORKS - BRINGING HAAR CASCADE TO THE PICTURE </h1>
    <br>
    <p> Haar-Features are good at detecting edges and lines. This makes it especial effective in face detection.
    Also as we don't need to train Haar-Features, we can create a classifier with a relatively small dataset. </p>
    <p> All we have to do is train the weightings for each feature which allows us to train the classifier well without a lot of training images. 
    In addition, it also has a higher execution speed, as Haar-based classifiers typically involve less computations. </p>
    <p> Another one of the primary benefits of Haar cascades is that they are just so fast â€” it's hard to beat their speed.</p>
