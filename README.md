## Working

This website we developed essentially tells us the benefits and code for facial recognition and emotion detection. This website logs the user into the website using Facial recognition and a password system to provide a double security. We can also run the facial recognition and emotion detection code inside website.

## Tools Used

### Front-end
HTML, CSS , JavaScript , Python
HTML will define the content and the basic structure of the website; CSS will be used to give style and structure to the content, while, JavaScript will be used to introduce interactive functionality to the website. The video capturing and analysis of image was done in python.

### Back-end
Node.js was helping us to connect python with HTML. 
MongoDB was used to store the image collected for future face recognition.
